# ML-Optimization-Prototypes This repository contains core implementations of bio-inspired optimization and sequence modeling developed during my MSIT research.

### Features:

Red Fox Optimization (RFO): Python implementation of meta-heuristic optimization for system responsiveness.

BiLSTM Architectures: Deep learning models for time-series prediction and system adaptation.

### Technical Stack:

Language: Python 3.10+

Frameworks: PyTorch / TensorFlow

Environment: Developed and tested on Ubuntu Linux.

Note: This repository serves as a technical portfolio for research applications. Detailed proprietary implementations are available upon request.
